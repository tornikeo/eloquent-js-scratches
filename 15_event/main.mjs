// WWW is different from internet in that
// WWW is a set of protocols that allow vising webpages
// while internet is WWW + non-website type connections
// like TCP and SMTP. WWW is a subset of Internet.

// In WWW, machines have IPs which is a number format 
// You can register instead a doman, which provides a
// more convenient string name, which then points to the
// said IP address.

// HTML is a document format. It is interpreted by the 
// browser to draw things on the screen.
